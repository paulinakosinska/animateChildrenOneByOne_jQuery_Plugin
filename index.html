<!-- The task is to create a jQuery plugin which will sequentially animate
subelements of the selected html element, according to parameters given
in its call.

For example, let's say we have an <ul> element, and we call the plugin
on it with animation type parameter "fadeIn", animation duration of
"500" (ms) and animation delay of "200" (ms).

Firing that makes all the subelements (<li>'s) appear on the page, one
after another, each with a 200ms delay from the previous one. In this
particular case, it means they will overlap, since the second one (or
even the third) will start fading in before the first one finished. -->
